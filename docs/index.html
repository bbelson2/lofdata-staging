    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p>Efficient water management and real-time environmental monitoring are crucial to achieving sustainable
      agriculture, enhancing water quality, and responding to climate-related challenges, especially in
      water-intensive crops such as sugarcane. This ongoing study describes the deployment, validation,
      and continuous operation of a robust, user-friendly, and cost-effective LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network)
      sensor network tailored specifically for Australian sugarcane farms.</p>

    <p>We developed an integrated IoT solution that includes reliable sensors, gateways, and streamlined registration
      processes designed explicitly for farmers. Sensor nodes, based on the robust Dragino SN50v3-LB units and
      equipped with temperature and humidity sensors, were deployed strategically within sugarcane fields, with a
      predicted battery life of 5-6 years. To maintain effective line-of-sight communication essential for LoRaWAN,
      sensors were mounted on flexible, breakaway PVC poles at 3.5 meters above ground, overcoming the challenges
      posed
      by dense sugarcane growth.</p>

    <p>An on-farm deployment has been running successfully at a sugarcane farm on the Atherton Tablelands, with sensor
      nodes placed up to 1.9 kilometres from a central gateway (MultiTech Conduit® IP67 Base Station). Data captured
      is transmitted in real-time and monitored via an intuitive smartphone application, providing immediate feedback
      on environmental conditions.</p>

    <p>Preliminary results indicate that the LoRaWAN system not only simplifies deployment and operation but also
      significantly enhances the precision of monitoring essential agricultural parameters, while maintaining privacy.
      This innovative approach improves farmers’ ability to manage resources sustainably, optimize crop yields, reduce
      run-off, and increase resilience to climate variability.</p>

    <p>Our findings demonstrate the potential of LoRaWAN technology as a scalable and sustainable solution for modern
      agriculture, promoting better resource management practices and facilitating a practical response to the urgent
      need for climate-smart agricultural systems. We plan to showcase operational devices at the conference, enabling
      hands-on demonstration and deeper insight into their deployment and practical application.</p>

  <div id="Introduction" name="Introduction" class="section">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Sugarcane farming is a significant agricultural activity in Australia, particularly in Queensland. However,
      traditional farming practices often lead to inefficient water usage and environmental degradation. The
      integration of IoT technologies, specifically LoRaWAN, offers a promising solution to these challenges by
      enabling real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making.</p>

    <p>By leveraging the capabilities of LoRaWAN, farmers can gain valuable insights into soil moisture levels, weather
      conditions, and crop health, allowing for more precise irrigation and resource management.</p>

    <div id="LoRaWAN" name="LoRaWAN" class="subsection">
      <h3>LoRaWAN</h3>
      <p>LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a low-power, wide-area networking protocol designed for IoT devices.
        It enables long-range communication with minimal power consumption, making it ideal for agricultural
        applications
        where devices may be spread over large areas and require extended battery life.</p>

  <div id="Methodology" name="Methodology" class="section">
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>The study involved the deployment of LoRaWAN sensor nodes across a sugarcane farm located on the Atherton
      Tablelands. The sensor nodes were based on Dragino SN50v3-LB units, equipped with temperature and humidity
      sensors, and mounted on flexible PVC poles at a height of 3.5 meters to ensure optimal line-of-sight
      communication.</p>

    <p>A MultiTech Conduit® IP67 Base Station served as the central gateway, receiving data from the sensor nodes and
      transmitting it to a cloud-based platform for real-time monitoring via a smartphone application.</p>

    <p>Data collected included temperature, humidity, and signal strength metrics, which were analyzed to assess the
      performance and reliability of the LoRaWAN network in the agricultural setting.</p>

    <div id="lorawan_gateway" name="lorawan_gateway" class="subsection">
      <h3>LoRaWAN Gateway</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://multitech.com/all-products/cellular/cellular-gateways/conduit-ip67-base-station/"
          target="_blank">
          MultiTech Conduit® IP67 Base Station</a> was selected for its robust design and reliable performance in
        outdoor
        environments. The gateway was configured and tested off-site. It was set to operate on the appropriate frequency
        band for Australia (915 MHz) and optimized for maximum coverage across the sugarcane farm.
        The gateway software was configured to allow remote management via secure connection.

      <div class="caption">Figure 2: Gateway Aerial Connections</div>

      <p>The selected installation site took advantage of an existing power pole, located next to a small pump shed.
        The area around the pump shed is clear of trees and other line-of-sight interruptions.
        The pole currently supports a Long-Range Outdoor Wireless Bridge, providing high bandwidth connectivity to the
        farm's main network.</p>

      <div class="caption">Figure 3: LoRaWAN Gateway Location</div>

      <p>This version of the gateway is powered using Power-over-Ethernet (PoE).
        Because of this, it does not require a separate power supply and can be easily installed in locations without
        access to traditional power outlets. However, it does require a compatible PoE injector or switch to provide
        power over the Ethernet cable if the supplied Ethernet connection does not support PoE. In this case, a PoE
        injector (Nextech YN8040) was used to ensure proper power delivery.</p>

        style="width:600px;height:auto;">
      <div class="caption">Figure 4: Nextech YN8040 PoE Injector</div>

      <p>The gateway aerial was mounted on the existing power pole, and connected to the gateway via a 10m coaxial
        cable.
        The gateway itself was fixed to the interior wall of the pump shed, next to the power pole,
        and connected to the farm's main network via Ethernet connection using the wireless bridge.</p>

      <h3>LoRaWAN Sensor Nodes</h3>
      <p>Sensor nodes were based on the <a
          href="https://www.dragino.com/products/lora-lorawan-end-node/item/260-sn50v3-lb-ls.html"
          target="_blank">Dragino
          SN50v3-LB platform</a>, chosen for its durability, long battery life, and
        compatibility with LoRaWAN networks. Each sensor node was equipped with temperature and humidity sensors to
        monitor environmental conditions within the sugarcane fields.</p>

      <div class="caption">Figure 6: LoRaWAN Sensor Node</div>

      <p>The use of these 3rd-party sensor nodes was decided after an analysis of the costs of designing and building
        our
        own nodes.
        See <a href="sensor_costs.html">Sensor node costs</a> for more details.</p>
      </p>

      <p>We connected a temperature and humidity sensor breakout board (<a
          href="https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SHT31-DIS-B" target="_blank">SHT31x</a>) to the LoRaWAN sensor
        node using the provided connectors, as shown in Fig. 7.</p>

      <div class="caption">Figure 7: Connecting sensors to node</div>

      <p>The device firmware was updated to support the new sensors and ensure proper communication with the LoRaWAN
        network. See <a href="notes/firmware.md">Firmware notes</a> for more details.</p>

    <div id="deploying_sensors" name="deploying_sensors" class="subsection">
      <h3>Sensor Deployment</h3>
      <p>To ensure optimal performance of the LoRaWAN sensor nodes, they were mounted on flexible PVC poles at a height
        of 3.5 meters above ground level. This height was chosen to provide a clear line-of-sight for communication with
        the gateway, overcoming the challenges posed by dense sugarcane growth.</p>

      <div class="caption">Figure 8: Sensor Node Mounted on PVC Pole</div>

      <p>The flexible poles were designed to break away safely if struck by farm machinery, minimizing the risk of
        damage to both the equipment and the sensor nodes.</p>


      <p>The costs for each sensor node deployment were kept low by using readily available materials and components.
        A list of the components used, along with their costs at the time of purchase, is provided in the table below.
        Note that these unit costs do not include bulk discounts.</p>
