    <h2>Abstract:</h2>

    <p>Efficient water management and real-time environmental monitoring are crucial to achieving sustainable
      agriculture, enhancing water quality, and responding to climate-related challenges, especially in
      water-intensive crops such as sugarcane. This ongoing study describes the deployment, validation,
      and continuous operation of a robust, user-friendly, and cost-effective LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network)
      sensor network tailored specifically for Australian sugarcane farms.</p>

    <p>We developed an integrated IoT solution that includes reliable sensors, gateways, and streamlined registration
      processes designed explicitly for farmers. Sensor nodes, based on the robust Dragino SN50v3-LB units and
      equipped with temperature and humidity sensors, were deployed strategically within sugarcane fields, with a
      predicted battery life of 5-6 years. To maintain effective line-of-sight communication essential for LoRaWAN,
      sensors were mounted on flexible, breakaway PVC poles at 3.5 meters above ground, overcoming the challenges
      posed
      by dense sugarcane growth.</p>

    <p>An on-farm deployment has been running successfully at a sugarcane farm on the Atherton Tablelands, with sensor
      nodes placed up to 1.9 kilometres from a central gateway (MultiTech Conduit® IP67 Base Station). Data captured
      is transmitted in real-time and monitored via an intuitive smartphone application, providing immediate feedback
      on environmental conditions.</p>

    <p>Preliminary results indicate that the LoRaWAN system not only simplifies deployment and operation but also
      significantly enhances the precision of monitoring essential agricultural parameters, while maintaining privacy.
      This innovative approach improves farmers’ ability to manage resources sustainably, optimize crop yields, reduce
      run-off, and increase resilience to climate variability.</p>

    <p>Our findings demonstrate the potential of LoRaWAN technology as a scalable and sustainable solution for modern
      agriculture, promoting better resource management practices and facilitating a practical response to the urgent
      need for climate-smart agricultural systems. We plan to showcase operational devices at the conference, enabling
      hands-on demonstration and deeper insight into their deployment and practical application.</p>

  <div id="Introduction" name="Introduction">
    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>Sugarcane farming is a significant agricultural activity in Australia, particularly in Queensland. However,
      traditional farming practices often lead to inefficient water usage and environmental degradation. The
      integration of IoT technologies, specifically LoRaWAN, offers a promising solution to these challenges by
      enabling real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making.</p>

    <p>By leveraging the capabilities of LoRaWAN, farmers can gain valuable insights into soil moisture levels, weather
      conditions, and crop health, allowing for more precise irrigation and resource management.</p>

    <h3>LoRaWAN</h3>
    <p>LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a low-power, wide-area networking protocol designed for IoT devices.
      It enables long-range communication with minimal power consumption, making it ideal for agricultural applications
      where devices may be spread over large areas and require extended battery life.</p>
