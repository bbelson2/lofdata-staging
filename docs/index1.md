## Abstract

Efficient water management and real-time environmental monitoring are crucial to achieving sustainable agriculture, enhancing water quality, and responding to climate-related challenges, especially in water-intensive crops such as sugarcane. This ongoing study describes the deployment, validation, and continuous operation of a robust, user-friendly, and cost-effective LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) sensor network tailored specifically for Australian sugarcane farms.

We developed an integrated IoT solution that includes reliable sensors, gateways, and streamlined registration processes designed explicitly for farmers. Sensor nodes, based on the robust Dragino SN50v3-LB units and equipped with temperature and humidity sensors, were deployed strategically within sugarcane fields, with a predicted battery life of 5-6 years. To maintain effective line-of-sight communication essential for LoRaWAN, sensors were mounted on flexible, breakaway PVC poles at 3.5 meters above ground, overcoming the challenges posed by dense sugarcane growth.

An on-farm deployment has been running successfully at a sugarcane farm on the Atherton Tablelands, with sensor nodes placed up to 1.9 kilometres from a central gateway (MultiTech Conduit® IP67 Base Station). Data captured is transmitted in real-time and monitored via an intuitive smartphone application, providing immediate feedback on environmental conditions.

Preliminary results indicate that the LoRaWAN system not only simplifies deployment and operation but also significantly enhances the precision of monitoring essential agricultural parameters, while maintaining privacy. This innovative approach improves farmers’ ability to manage resources sustainably, optimize crop yields, reduce run-off, and increase resilience to climate variability. 

Our findings demonstrate the potential of LoRaWAN technology as a scalable and sustainable solution for modern agriculture, promoting better resource management practices and facilitating a practical response to the urgent need for climate-smart agricultural systems. We plan to showcase operational devices at the conference, enabling hands-on demonstration and deeper insight into their deployment and practical application.
